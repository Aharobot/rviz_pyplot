rviz_pyplot
===========

Functions that allow simple plotting to rviz from Python.

Documentation is sparse, but to get started, try the following:

1. Start roscore
2. Start rviz
3. In rviz, under "Global Options", set the "Fixed Frame" to rviz_pyplot
4. Run the example scripts in the ```rviz_pyplot/examples``` folder.
5. Now read the scripts to get an idea of what magic is happening there.
